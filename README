This is collection of bunch of example application and utilities for
exploration of native Android (essentially, Linux) environment -
written by repo maintainer, collected from the net, and pulled from AOSP.

This project depends on https://github.com/pfalcon/android-platform-headers
(and so far, still on AOSP tree).
